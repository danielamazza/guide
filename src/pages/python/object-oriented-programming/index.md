Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm in which properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. In other words, data and methods to manipulate it are kept as units called objects.
For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running.

OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.
